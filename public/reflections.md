# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
        
## 1. Variable Declaration
### - Unlike in C++, you do not need specific keywords for different variable types. Instead, you can simply use 'var' or 'let', and JavaScript will determine the variable type from the value given.
## 2. Arithmetic Operators
### - The operators used in JavaScript have no difference from the ones used in C++. These operators includ "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication, "-" for division, "%" for addition, "++" for increment, and "--" for decrement.
## 3. Comparison and Logical Operators
### - Comparison operators are used to compare two values. "==" and "!=" checks whether the two values are equal or not, ">" and "<" check whether one value is greater/less than the other, and ">=" and "<=" is similar to the previous but inclusive. Meanwhile, logical operators are usually used with comparison operators. "&&" checks if both conditions are met and "||" checks if at least one of the conditions are met
## 4. If/If-else Statements
### - Control statements include if, if-else, and switch statements, as well as rational and logical operators.
## 5. Switch Statements
### - These structures include while, do-while, and for loops.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why. The why should be per topic listed. 

## 1. Loop Control Structures
### - I know when, where, and how to use these types of control structures, but I have yet to explore the capabilities of these functions, especially for loops, as those include iterative and incremental statements.
## 2. Native/Built-in Functions
### - We have discussed a few of these, including alert() and prompt(), but there are many, many more that we have yet to explore.
## 3. Custom Functions
### - I still do not fully understand how to use custom functions, specifically ones with an argument list, as those 
## 4. Processing function output
### - As we have barely used functions, specifically custom functions, I do not have much experience doing this.
## 5. HTML Events
### - I still do not know how to properly use HTML events, especially because these were not discussed as much just yet in our CS3 classes.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

## 1. Loop Control Structures
### - Explore various challenges and coding problems to widen my understanding in coding and refine my coding skills. In the process, I can learn how to creatively and effectively use loop control structures in a clean, efficient way.         
## 2. Native/Built-in Functions
### - Do not memorize; recognize what kind of native functions I need in my code, and learn along the way over the course of days/weeks. Over time, these functions, the necesary ones, will be stored in my memory.
## 3. Custom Functions
### - Try practicing using these functions as much as possible, in an efficient way, while coding. Eventually
## 4. Processing Function Output
### - Just like the plan of action in custom functions, maximize the use of these functions by specifically making complicated, difficult coding problems for myself, forcing myself to declare, build, call, and output functions effectively and efficiently.
## 5. HTML Events
### - Don't just explore coding problems and challenges in the console; incorporate website design and function into coding to make it more challenging for me.


# In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?

## The two activities that I think were effective are:
## 1. 1st Graded Exercise
### - This activity was very effective in teaching us how to make a repository, as well as letting us learn how to commit and fork in VSCode, which we do every time we want to save an activity and send it to the repository.
## 2. 7th Graded Exercise
### - To me, this was effective in helping me understand the topic, as I was forced to analyze the entire code and learn how to detect Armstrong numbers. Additionally, I learned here how to return values when calling functions, and how to effectively call functions using console.log.

## The two activities that I think were *not* effective are:
## 1. 4th Graded Exercise
### - To me, the solution to this activity was too obvious. Most of the code can be encompassed into a single switch statement comprising of all the languages.
## 2. 6th Graded Exercise
### - In my opinion, this activity was not effective, as it was too simple to challenge people's critical thinking skills and creativity.
